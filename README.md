## API Security

Securing the backend APIs is a critical aspect of the Airbnb Clone project. The following key security measures will be implemented:

### Authentication
All users must verify their identity before accessing protected endpoints using secure login mechanisms (e.g., JWT or session-based authentication).  
**Importance:** Ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive features like bookings, payments, and personal profiles.

### Authorization
Different user roles (e.g., guest, host, admin) will have specific permissions to control access to resources.  
**Importance:** Prevents unauthorized users from performing actions they are not allowed to, such as modifying other users’ bookings or properties.

### Rate Limiting
Limits the number of requests a user can make in a certain time frame to prevent abuse or denial-of-service attacks.  
**Importance:** Protects the backend from overload, ensuring consistent performance and availability.

### Data Encryption
Sensitive data, including passwords and payment information, will be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest.  
**Importance:** Protects user data from interception or theft, maintaining privacy and trust.

### Input Validation and Sanitization
All user inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).  
**Importance:** Ensures that malicious data cannot compromise the database or application integrity.

Implementing these security measures ensures that the backend is robust, protects user data, and maintains trust and reliability throughout the platform.


## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines are automated workflows that help streamline the development, testing, and deployment of the application. They ensure that code changes are integrated frequently, tested automatically, and deployed safely to production environments.

### Importance for the Project
- **Automated Testing:** Ensures new features or bug fixes do not break existing functionality.  
- **Faster Deployment:** Reduces manual effort and allows the team to deliver updates quickly and reliably.  
- **Consistency:** Guarantees that all environments (development, staging, production) are consistent and reproducible.  
- **Early Error Detection:** Helps catch issues before they reach production, improving application stability.

### Tools
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates testing, building, and deployment workflows directly from the GitHub repository.  
- **Docker:** Provides containerization to ensure that the application runs consistently across all environments.  
- **Other Tools:** CI/CD can also include tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or Travis CI depending on the team’s preference.
