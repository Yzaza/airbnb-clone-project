## Database Design

The Airbnb Clone backend uses a relational database to store and manage data efficiently. Below are the key entities and their relationships:

### Users
- **Fields:** 
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `username`: Unique username for login
  - `email`: User email
  - `password`: Hashed password for authentication
  - `date_joined`: Timestamp of registration
- **Relationships:** 
  - A user can create multiple properties (if a host).  
  - A user can make multiple bookings.  
  - A user can post multiple reviews.

### Properties
- **Fields:** 
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `title`: Property name or title
  - `description`: Property description
  - `price_per_night`: Cost per night
  - `host_id`: Foreign key to Users
- **Relationships:** 
  - Each property belongs to a single host (user).  
  - A property can have multiple bookings.  
  - A property can receive multiple reviews.

### Bookings
- **Fields:** 
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `user_id`: Foreign key to Users
  - `property_id`: Foreign key to Properties
  - `check_in`: Start date
  - `check_out`: End date
  - `total_amount`: Calculated cost
- **Relationships:** 
  - Each booking belongs to one user and one property.  

### Reviews
- **Fields:** 
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `user_id`: Foreign key to Users
  - `property_id`: Foreign key to Properties
  - `rating`: Numeric rating
  - `comment`: Review text
  - `created_at`: Timestamp of submission
- **Relationships:** 
  - Each review belongs to one user and one property.  

### Payments
- **Fields:** 
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `booking_id`: Foreign key to Bookings
  - `amount`: Paid amount
  - `payment_date`: Timestamp of payment
  - `status`: Payment status (e.g., completed, pending)
- **Relationships:** 
  - Each payment is associated with a single booking.

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Enables users to register, authenticate, and manage their profiles securely. This feature ensures that both hosts and guests have a personalized and secure experience within the platform.

### Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and manage property listings. It includes details like property description, pricing, and availability, ensuring that users can browse and select suitable accommodations.

### Booking System
Handles reservation requests, check-in/check-out dates, and booking statuses. This system links users to properties, ensuring a seamless process for making and managing reservations.

### Payment Processing
Integrates a secure payment mechanism to handle transactions related to bookings. It ensures financial data is protected and allows both guests and hosts to track payments efficiently.

### Review System
Enables users to leave ratings and comments for properties. This feature provides feedback for hosts and informs future guests about the quality of accommodations.

### API Documentation
Provides structured API endpoints using OpenAPI standards and GraphQL queries. This ensures developers can integrate with the backend easily and understand how to interact with the system effectively.

### Database Optimizations
Implements indexing and caching strategies to enhance performance. This ensures fast data retrieval, reduces server load, and improves the overall responsiveness of the platform.


## API Security

Securing the backend APIs is a critical aspect of the Airbnb Clone project. The following key security measures will be implemented:

### Authentication
All users must verify their identity before accessing protected endpoints using secure login mechanisms (e.g., JWT or session-based authentication).  
**Importance:** Ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive features like bookings, payments, and personal profiles.

### Authorization
Different user roles (e.g., guest, host, admin) will have specific permissions to control access to resources.  
**Importance:** Prevents unauthorized users from performing actions they are not allowed to, such as modifying other users’ bookings or properties.

### Rate Limiting
Limits the number of requests a user can make in a certain time frame to prevent abuse or denial-of-service attacks.  
**Importance:** Protects the backend from overload, ensuring consistent performance and availability.

### Data Encryption
Sensitive data, including passwords and payment information, will be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest.  
**Importance:** Protects user data from interception or theft, maintaining privacy and trust.

### Input Validation and Sanitization
All user inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).  
**Importance:** Ensures that malicious data cannot compromise the database or application integrity.

Implementing these security measures ensures that the backend is robust, protects user data, and maintains trust and reliability throughout the platform.


## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines are automated workflows that help streamline the development, testing, and deployment of the application. They ensure that code changes are integrated frequently, tested automatically, and deployed safely to production environments.

### Importance for the Project
- **Automated Testing:** Ensures new features or bug fixes do not break existing functionality.  
- **Faster Deployment:** Reduces manual effort and allows the team to deliver updates quickly and reliably.  
- **Consistency:** Guarantees that all environments (development, staging, production) are consistent and reproducible.  
- **Early Error Detection:** Helps catch issues before they reach production, improving application stability.

### Tools
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates testing, building, and deployment workflows directly from the GitHub repository.  
- **Docker:** Provides containerization to ensure that the application runs consistently across all environments.  
- **Other Tools:** CI/CD can also include tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or Travis CI depending on the team’s preference.
